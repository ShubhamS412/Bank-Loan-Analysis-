# Bank-Loan-Analysis-
This project justifies a financial institution leverages Power BI to analyze and visualize bank loan details. The project involves creating a dashboard that showcases key metrics like good loans and bad loans using bar charts to compare loan performance over time. A donut chart is used to display the distribution of loan types, such as personal loans, mortgages, and business loans. Tables are utilized to present detailed loan data, including loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment statuses. Slicers enable users to filter data based on criteria like loan type, borrower demographics, or loan status for deeper analysis. DAX expressions are applied to calculate important metrics like loan default rates, total loan amounts disbursed, and average interest rates, providing actionable insights for decision-makers in the financial institution.
